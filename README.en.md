## **Life and Family**

**Lewis Howard Latimer** was born in **Chelsea, Massachusetts**, in **1848**, the son of **George** and **Rebecca Latimer**, both formerly enslaved people who gained their freedom through a landmark court case.  
That legacy of courage, struggle, and perseverance shaped his conscience and inspired him to turn adversity into human progress.

In **1873**, he married **Mary Wilson Lewis**, with whom he had two daughters — **Emma Jeanette** and **Louise Rebecca**.  
His family carefully preserved his manuscripts, technical drawings, and records, which today are part of the **Lewis H. Latimer House Museum**, in New York.

## **Youth and War**

During the **American Civil War**, at just **16 years old**, Latimer enlisted as a **landsman** in the **Union Navy**, serving aboard the **USS Massasoit**.  
It was during this period that he developed discipline, courage, and a deep sense of duty — virtues that would define his entire life.

After leaving the Navy with honors, he began working in a **patent law office in Boston**, where he discovered his passion for **technical drawing**.  
A self-taught learner, he became an expert in **mechanical and electrical engineering**, paving the way for one of the most remarkable careers of the Industrial Era.
